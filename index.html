  <h5 style="text-align: center;"><b>Ratings:</b> 10/10</h5>
  <h5 style="text-align: left;">
    <i>"I’ve been farming for over 20 years, and this is hands down one of the best tools I’ve ever used. The ground scanner saved us so much time by detecting rocks before we started tilling — no more equipment damage or surprises. Even better, it gave us clear data on soil quality, helping us decide exactly where to plant for the best yield. It’s smart, accurate, and a total game-changer for modern farming. I recommend it to every farmer I know!"</i>

    <h5><b>Ratings:</b> 9/10</h5>
    <h5><i>"The ground scanner has made a big difference on our farm. It helped us avoid rocky patches that used to damage our equipment and gave useful insight into soil quality. I only wish the battery lasted a little longer for larger fields — but overall, it’s an excellent investment!"</i></h5>

    <h5><b>Ratings:</b> 8/10</h5>
    <h5><i>"This tool is really helpful for checking soil conditions before planting. It definitely made our job easier and more accurate. That said, the interface could be more user-friendly for folks who aren't very tech-savvy. Still a solid product that I’ll keep using!"</i></h5>
