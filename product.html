    1. <i>The AgDrone</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="font family: sans-serif;">
    We start of the product line by offering our drone. The AgDrone is no different in controls or feel from standard consumer drones, other than the fact it is beefed up with a heavy duty aluminum chassis, attachment points for our accessories, high thrust propellers to hold up the extra weight and stay stable in windy weather.

    2. <i>The Pesterminator Line </i>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="font family: sans-serif;">
    Our answer for the growing number of pests, nuisances and other vermin that destroy fields and cause thousands in crop damages. It is a drone with a automated spray system to coat each field with precision with our signature Pest-free Freedom formula. Our awaiting patent approval pesticide works by spraying a pheromone that repels insects, in a super high concentration that disorients the creature, ultimately stunning it. Our mission is to ensure your crops will be pest free and safe to consume.

    3. <i>Geo Scanner</i>
    <br><br>
      <p style="font family: sans-serif;">
    After hearing many complaints from farmers having to constantly get in and out of the tractor while doing the first plow of the season to discard of those pesky rocks that dull the blades, we decided to give farmers a way to find the fieldstones behore hand. Simply attatch or scanner to any commonly avalible drone via our mount and fly ~20 ft above the filed's surface. The drone will send electrical signals downward and look for changes in freqency coming back, thus indicating a different material than dirt. The scanner will tranmit a notification to the drone's viewing screen and highlight the fieldstone, or any other obstruction in red. <i>You may ask yourself what to do with all your fieldstones. Attatched is a site with plenty of great ideas!</i> <a href="url">https://www.saundersls.com/what-can-i-do-with-fieldstones/#:~:text=Fieldstones%20occur%20because%20of%20glacial,from%20this%20last%20glacial%20period.</a>
